â€¢ E-commerce website built to showcase my developing skills.
â€¢ I didn't have products to sell, so I just used prop data in a JS file, which replicates how I would deal with real data.
â€¢ The shopping cart is implemented inside the navbar, which can be opened with a click so the user doesn't have to go to a separate page to view their cart.
â€¢ Complex Redux State Management was used to add products to the cart from multiple sections of the website.
â€¢ Many things were taken into consideration, for example, after the user adds a product to the cart, there's a code checking if the same item is already in the cart, and if it is, it won't add a new product. Instead, it will just increase the quantity of that product, as well as increase the sum and the counter of how many products have been added.
â€¢ Once the user removes a product from the cart, the sum will decrease based on the price of the product multiplied by the quantity of that product.
